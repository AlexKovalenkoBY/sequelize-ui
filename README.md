## About

[**Sequelize UI**](https://sequelizeui.app) provides a user-friendly interface for designing a relational database and generating [Sequelize ORM](https://sequelize.org/) model code for a Node.js project.

Use the code previewer to see the generated Sequelize code for your models, including configuration such as table/column name casing and pluralization.
